== Description ==

This plugin adds a shortcode that allows you to easily embed the Action Button into a post.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is Action Button? =

Action Button is a product that embeds in your content to provide your audience with meaningful ways that they can take action on the issue areas that are addressed in your article. We work hard to vet all of our NGO partners, and we don't link your audience off to a different site. All actions can be done completely from your article so your readers never have to leave the page. Some of the actions we currently provide are:

* Contact your congressional representative about an issue (Tweet, Email, and Call)

* Make A Donation 
* Polls
* Quizzes
* Send An Email
* Tweet
